# Articles Code Challenge

## Overview
This project implements a system to model the relationships between Authors, Articles, and Magazines using raw SQL queries with SQLite, without SQLAlchemy. It supports one-to-many relationships (Authors to Articles, Magazines to Articles) and a many-to-many relationship (Authors to Magazines via Articles). The project includes a database schema, Python classes with SQL methods, transaction handling, and a CLI tool for interactive queries.
